Introduction,

 This program mainly focused on calculating GPA values of students. It is very 
easy to work with this program. I mainly focused on Eleven aspects such as, Users should be able to 
insert their general information, (Department, Name, Index Number), Add New course For List, To 
Register a new course That is mean, Registered Students should be able to add new courses to their list, 
Insert Grade Point Values, That is mean Registered users should be able to add GPV value for registered 
courses, Generate Student Report(It includes All the data of the student Name, Department, Index 
Number, and courses details that student registered Course Id, Course Name, Registered Date, GPV, 
Grade, and Current Grade Point Average.) In addition, should be able to update inserted data such as 
Student General Data, Registered courses, Inserted GPV, and Delete the student profile, Assuming that, 
every student has a unique ID. According to the requirements of this system, I use C Programming 
Language. Since It has Structures, Dynamic Memory allocation, File Handling, array, switch 
statements, loops and etc.
